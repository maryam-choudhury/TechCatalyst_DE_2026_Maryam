# Formulas
# Variance = Settlement - Reserve
# Percent Change = Variance / Reserve x 100

# Create a float variable for the reserve
reserve:float
reserve = 5000

# Create a float variable for the settlement
settlement:float
settlement = 6200

# Calculate the variance (settlement minus reserve)
variance = settlement - reserve

# Calculate the percent change
percent_change = variance/reserve*100

# Print the reserve
print(f"Claim CLM-1001 reserve was ${reserve:.2f}")

# Print the settlement
print(f"Claim CLM-1001 settled at ${settlement:.2f}")

# Print the percent change
print(f"Claim CLM-1001 percent change was ${percent_change:.2f}")
