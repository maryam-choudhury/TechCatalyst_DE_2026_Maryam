# Week 1 · Day 3: Lab

**Theme:** Developer foundations — Python environments, then a Git and GitHub deep dive (plus VS Code and Codespaces)
**Format:** Five guided labs in pairs (navigator and driver, swap every 20 min). Lab A is the new hands-on environments lab; Labs B and C are the Git/GitHub core; Labs D and E are the fun ones — the profile page and your live GitHub Pages site.

> **AI-Free Zone (Weeks 1 to 4).** Type every command yourself. No Copilot, no LLM-generated code, SQL, or Git commands. Read the errors; debug first.

### Suggested timing

| Time | Block |
| :--- | :--- |
| 10:15 to 11:15 | **Lab A: Python environments & package management** (about 50–60 min) |
| 1:00 to 1:45 | Lab B: Git, the solo cycle (about 45 min) |
| 1:45 to 2:45 | Lab C: GitHub — remote & collaboration (about 60 min; Section 2 is time-permitting) |
| 2:45 to 3:00 | Labs D & E (Fun Labs): your GitHub profile page and GitHub Pages site (start; finish as homework) |

*(Times are a guide. Lab A is the new centerpiece that fixes yesterday's environment confusion — protect the uv section. This cohort knows Git basics, so B runs fast; in Lab C, Parts 1–4 are the must-do core and the branch/PR section is the Week 2 on-ramp.)*

### Deliverables

| # | Deliverable | Format | From | Due |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Notes answering the Lab A reflection (the two jobs; `uv add` vs `uv sync`; when to use each tool) | Notes | Lab A | End of day |
| 2 | Pushed `techcatalyst-2026-<yourname>` repo with `hello_data.py`, `data/hartford_claims_sample.csv`, `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore` | GitHub repo | Lab B + C | End of day |
| 3 | Completed Part 5 verification checklist committed into `README.md`; at least 3 commits in `git log --oneline`, partner-verified | Markdown + Git history | Lab B | End of day |
| 4 | A clone of your repo verified to match (`journal-clone`) | Git history | Lab C | End of day |
| 5 | *(time-permitting)* About section merged into `main` via a pull request; branch deleted; Q1–Q5 noted | Notes + repo | Lab C | End of day |
| 6 | A GitHub profile page live at `github.com/<username>` (the `<username>/<username>` repo) | GitHub profile | Lab D | End of day / homework |
| 7 | A live GitHub Pages site at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/` with a welcome page and first post | GitHub Pages site | Lab E | End of day / homework |

## How the day fits together

**Lab A** is new and comes first: students run conda, venv + pip, and **uv** back-to-back on the same tiny task so the differences they were confused about yesterday become concrete — conda's careful-but-heavy solver, venv's "it's just a folder" simplicity, and uv's one-tool projects with a `pyproject.toml` and automatic lock file. It's a throwaway sandbox; the course baseline stays venv + pip.

**Lab B** is **entirely local** to the Codespace: students build their real course repo (using the venv + pip baseline), read the sample data with a hand-written script, and practice the solo Git cycle (status, add, diff, commit, log) without touching GitHub.

**Lab C** **connects local to remote**: push, pull, clone, and fetch/merge (Section 1), then branch, pull request, review, and merge (Section 2), the on-ramp to the shared-repo collaboration and merge conflicts covered in full on Week 2 Day 1.

**Lab D** (Fun Lab) turns everything into a **GitHub profile page** — a personal branding page students grow every week of the program.

**Lab E** (Fun Lab) goes one step further: students publish a real **GitHub Pages website** — a themed welcome page plus a mini-blog — from a provided HTML/CSS template. Like the profile, it's a living portfolio they feed with one short post a week, all program long. Both fun labs reinforce today's repo/commit skills with zero Codespace cost.

## Troubleshooting

See `GitHub Troubleshooting.md` in this folder. The most common live issues: in Lab A, `conda activate` needs `conda init bash` + a fresh terminal, and `uv` needs `source $HOME/.local/bin/env` after install; in Lab C, the Codespaces 403 on first push (handled with Path A and Path B). Stuck more than 10 minutes? Raise a hand; debugging together is the point, but so is finishing.
